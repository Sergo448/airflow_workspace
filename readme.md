Usage
To get started with the code examples, start Airflow with Docker Compose with the following command:

docker-compose up -d
The webserver initializes a few things, so wait for a few seconds, and you should be able to access the Airflow webserver at http://localhost:8080.

To stop running the examples, run the following command:

docker-compose down -v
